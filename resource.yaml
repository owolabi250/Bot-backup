  description: C is a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
    C is very widely used, straightforward, and can be compiled to a number of platforms
    and operating systems. C is an imperative language, with a small number of keywords
    and a large number of mathematical operators. C is also a very low level programming
    language, which means it can communicate directly with hardware.
